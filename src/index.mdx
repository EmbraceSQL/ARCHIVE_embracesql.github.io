EmbraceSQL for data access -- you write the SQL -- we’ll do the REST!

Learn about the [Problems](./problems) with data access. Then [Get Started](#getting-started).

## Getting Started
You'll need to have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Run the EmbraceSQL Docker container with our sample SQLite database. You can do
this in any directory you like, just know that files will be created there!
```shell
docker pull embrace-sql
docker run embrace-sql init
docker run embrace-sql start
```

Now you'll see some output from EmbraceSQL starting.

Check out the OpenAPI at http://localhost:8765/, notice the `hello` route, GET it!

```shell
curl http://localhost:8765/hello
```

In your shell in the current directory where you ran EmbraceSQL, do a quick `ls`.

* Notice the embracesql.yml -- that’s the config
* Notice the embracesql.db -- that’s a sample database
* Notice the hello.sql -- that’s what just ran
* Notice the ./migrations -- we’ll get to that

Replace the contents of `hello.sql`.

```sql
SELECT ?
```

And now use that parameter. This is just a ? -- so it is not a named parameter, so you just set a parameter by its zero based index. 

```shell
curl http://localhost:8765/hello?0=world
```

And of course, you can post your parameters:

```shell
curl --request POST --data '["world"]' http://localhost:8765/hello
```

And that's it -- you have just created a REST API with nothing but SQL.

From here, let's make something more sophisticated with [Databases](./databases), [Tables](./tables), and [SQL APIs](./sqlapi).
