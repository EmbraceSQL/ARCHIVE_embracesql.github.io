## Getting Started

EmbraceSQL generates client libraries for JavaScript and TypeScript along with type definitions for your databases, tables, and SQL APIs automatically, creating files on disk you can reference for client code and handler implementations.

The big benefit of these clients, compared to just using an HTTP client library is type autocompletion in your editor, and for folks s inclined, static type checkign with the TypeScript compiler.
