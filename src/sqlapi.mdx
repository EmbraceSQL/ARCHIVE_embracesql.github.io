## Getting Started


### Selecting a Database
How does an SQL API know which database to use? The answer is default is the default, but you can set it in a hook. Let’s modify our hook to peek and see the database.
```things/all.sql.before.js
Export const before = (context) => {
  console.log(context.database);
}
```
Back in the shell where we ran EmbraceSQL, watch as you GET http://localhost:8765/things/all, you will see:

```
{default: “sqlite:embracesql.db”}
```
