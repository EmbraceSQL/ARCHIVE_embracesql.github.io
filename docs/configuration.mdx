## Example Confguration

Best way to understand the configuration is with a full sample.

Databases are 'named', names such as `default`, `other`, and these names are used 
in the generation of clients and typed context.

```yaml title="./embracesql.yml"
databases:
  default: sqlite:embracesql.db
  other: sqlite:other.db
  postgres: postgresql://${USER}:${PASSWORD}@${HOST}:${PORT}/${DB}
twin_commands_to: kafka:hostname:port/topic
```
