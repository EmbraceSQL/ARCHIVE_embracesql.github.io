## Example Confguration

Best way to understand the configuration is with a full sample.

Databases are 'named', names such as `default`, `other`, and these names are used 
in the generation of clients and typed context.

```yaml title="./embracesql.yml"
databases:
  default: sqlite:embracesql.db
  other: sqlite:other.db
  postgres: postgresql://${USER}:${PASSWORD}@${HOST}:${PORT}/${DB}
twin_commands_to: kafka:hostname:port/topic
```

## File Tree

You run EmbraceSQL in any folder you like -- this is the root. 
A default root folder should look like:

```
after.js
afterBatch.js
afterError.js
afterMigration.js
before.js
beforeBatch.js
beforeMigration.js
beforeStreamMessage.js
embracesql.yml
hello.sql
migrations/
resolveSQL.js
validateToken.js
```

You can make any folders you like to organize your SQL, the recommendation is to have a folder per database.
Within each database folder, organize by use case or topic area of your application.
